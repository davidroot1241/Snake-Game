# Snake-Game
Dusting off my BASIC coding knowledge from the 90s
Game Setup: The snake starts with a length of 1 at position (10, 10), and food is placed randomly on the screen.
Snake Movement: The snake moves according to the user input (W, A, S, D for up, left, down, and right). Each time the snake moves, the body parts follow the head.
Game Over Condition: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or collides with itself.
Food Consumption: When the snake eats food (denoted by *), its length increases by 1 and the score increments. New food is placed randomly on the board after each consumption.
Display: The game is displayed on a 20x20 grid with boundaries drawn on the top and bottom.
